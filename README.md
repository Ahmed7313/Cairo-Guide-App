 This is the Thired App I have created for Google Basics NanoDegree.
 
 Its main goal was to learn how to create a multiscreen App

- **This is how the App looks like**

# The goal of this project was to learn:
 -   Planning the app design and navigation before coding

-   Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information

-   Building layouts to display those lists of data

-   Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout or Navigation Drawer
-   Creating my own custom classes
-   Properly handling images
 
# I have used through this project:
**Coordinator Layout**

**Custom ActionBarLayout**

**ScrollableView for the ActionBar**

**Explicit and Implicit Intent**

**Custome Classes**

**ViewPager with toolbar**

**Navigation Drawer**

**CustomeAdapter to recycle the views**

**ListView**

**Collapsed Text**
